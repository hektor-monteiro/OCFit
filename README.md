# OCFit
==============

source code for the fitting software written in Python 3.7 to fit isochrones
to photometric data of open clusters.

version 3.7. The code also requires the following modules: 

scipy
astropy
multiprocessing

CAVEATS
==================

- the input data files have to be in a specific format which can be seen in the sample file included. The user can take that as a template for other objects

- Missing data such as magnitudes, are still not implemengted so files must have no NaNs
